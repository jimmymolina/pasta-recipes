With its creamy cheese sauce enveloping al dente pasta, it strikes the perfect balance between richness and comfort.

   - Once melted, whisk in the flour to form a roux, cooking for about 1-2 minutes until slightly bubbly.
   - Gradually add the milk while continuously whisking to prevent lumps. 
   - Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens slightly.
   - Reduce heat to low and begin stirring in the shredded cheese until melted and smooth.

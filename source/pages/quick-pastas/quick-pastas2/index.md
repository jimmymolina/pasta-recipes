Pasta with Quick Tomato Sauce is a delightful and simple dish that can be made in under 30 minutes. 


This recipe is perfect for busy weeknights or when you want a comforting meal without a lot of fuss. 

The sauce is vibrant and fresh, highlighting the simplicity of good-quality ingredients. 



- **For the Pasta:**

  - 12 oz (340g) of your choice of pasta (spaghetti, penne, fusilli, etc.)

  - Salt for boiling water

- **For the Quick Tomato Sauce:**

  - 2 tbsp olive oil

  - 3-4 garlic cloves, minced

  - 1 (14 oz) can of diced tomatoes (or 4-5 fresh ripe tomatoes, chopped)

  - 1 tsp dried oregano (or Italian seasoning)

  - Salt and pepper to taste

  - Fresh basil leaves, for garnish

  - Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)


<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Boil the Pasta:**

   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the rest. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Quick Tomato Sauce:**

   - In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, or until fragrant, but be careful not to burn it.

   - Stir in the diced tomatoes (with their juice) and oregano. 
   
   - Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
   
   - If you’re using fresh tomatoes, you may need to cook for an additional 5-10 minutes until they break down.

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**

   - Once the sauce has thickened slightly, add the drained pasta to the skillet. 
   
   - Toss to coat the pasta in the sauce. 
   
   - If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**

   - Remove from heat, and garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. 
   
   - Serve immediately.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. **Spicy Tomato Sauce:**

   -Add a pinch of red pepper flakes when sautéing the garlic for some heat.

2. **Creamy Tomato Sauce:**

   -Stir in a splash of heavy cream or a dollop of cream cheese at the end for a creamier texture.

3. **Vegetable-Packed Sauce:**

   -Add chopped vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, or mushrooms to the sauce for extra nutrition.

4. **Protein Boost:**

   -Incorporate cooked ground beef, turkey, or sausage for a heartier dish.

5. **Herb Variations:**

   -Experiment with fresh herbs like thyme, parsley, or rosemary for different flavor profiles.

6. **Make it Vegan:**

   -Simply skip the Parmesan cheese and use nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.
   

This basic recipe serves as a great foundation that you can customize according to your taste and dietary preferences.

Pasta with Lemon and Parmesan is a refreshingly simple dish that highlights the bright flavors of citrus and the deep, savory notes of cheese. This dish makes for a quick weeknight meal, yet it feels elegant enough for entertaining. The lemon adds a zesty brightness that complements the nuttiness of the Parmesan cheese, making it a delightful choice for pasta lovers.

### Ingredients

- **Pasta**: 250g (e.g., spaghetti, fettuccine, or linguine)
- **Lemon**: 1 large (zest and juice)
- **Parmesan cheese**: 100g, freshly grated (plus extra for serving)
- **Olive oil**: 2-3 tablespoons
- **Garlic**: 2 cloves, minced (optional)
- **Salt**: to taste
- **Black pepper**: to taste
- **Fresh parsley**: for garnish (optional)

### Step-by-Step Preparation Method

1. **Cook the Pasta**: 
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   - Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
   - Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

2. **Prepare the Lemon Sauce**: 
   - While the pasta is cooking, zest the lemon and then juice it. 
   - Set aside.
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   - If using, add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**: 
   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet. 
   - Pour the lemon juice and add the zest to the pasta. 
   - Toss everything together until well combined. 
   - Gradually add in the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached (the sauce should be creamy without being too oily).

4. **Add Cheese and Season**: 
   - Remove the skillet from heat and add in the grated Parmesan cheese, stirring until melted and combined. 
   - Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.

5. **Serve**: 
   - Plate the pasta, garnishing with additional Parmesan and chopped fresh parsley if desired. 
   - Enjoy immediately!

### Variations

1. **Vegetable Additions**: 
   - Add sautéed spinach, peas, or asparagus for a nutritional boost.
  
2. **Protein Boost**: 
   - Incorporate grilled chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas for a filling meal.

3. **Herb Variations**: 
   - Substitute parsley with fresh basil or arugula for a different flavor profile.

4. **Spice It Up**: 
   - Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat.

5. **Creamy Version**: 
   - For a creamier sauce, add a splash of heavy cream or a dollop of mascarpone cheese along with the Parmesan.

6. **Nutty Pesto Alternative**: 
   - Blend in a tablespoon of pesto for a nutty flavor that complements the lemon beautifully.

- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

- 1/3 cup pine nuts (or walnuts)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method:</b></u>

<u><b>1. Prepare the Pesto Sauce:</b></u>

   1. **Toast the Nuts**: 
   
   - (Optional) In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the pine nuts for a few minutes until golden brown. 
   
   - Stir frequently to prevent burning. Let them cool.

   2. **Blend Ingredients**: 
   
   - In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, cooled pine nuts, minced garlic, and Parmesan cheese. 
   
   - Pulse until finely chopped.

   3. **Add Olive Oil**: 
   
   - With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture is smooth. 
   
   - You may need to scrape down the sides a few times.

   4. **Season**: 
   
   - Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice (if using) to taste. 
   
   - Blend again until well combined.

<u><b>2. Cook the Pasta:</b></u>

   1. **Boil Water**: 
   
   - Fill a large pot with water and add a generous amount of salt. 
   
   - Bring to a boil.

   2. **Cook Pasta**: Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.

   3. **Reserve Pasta Water:** </b></u>
   
   - Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of pasta water. 
   
   - This can be used to help adjust the sauce later if needed.

   4.<u><b>Drain</b></u>: Drain the pasta and return it to the pot, off the heat.

<u><b>3. Combine Pasta and Pesto:</b></u>

   1. **Mix**: Add the pesto sauce to the pasta and toss gently to combine.

   2. **Adjust Consistency**: If the pasta seems dry, add a bit of reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.

<u><b>4. Serve:</b></u>

   1. **Plate**: Serve the pesto pasta in bowls.

   2. **Garnish**: Top with additional grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves.

   3. **Enjoy**: Serve immediately and enjoy!



<u><b>Variations:</b></u>

1. **Protein Boost**: Add grilled chicken, shrimp, or saut√©ed vegetables for added protein and nutrition.
   
2. **Nut-Free**: Use sunflower seeds or omit nuts altogether for a nut-free version. 

3. **Vegan**: Substitute nutritional yeast for Parmesan cheese and omit cheese for a vegan-friendly option.

4. **Different Greens**: Experiment with different herbs and greens, like spinach, arugula, or kale, in place of basil for unique flavor profiles.

5. **Creamy Pesto**: Mix in a small amount of cream or cream cheese for a richer, creamier sauce.

6. **Roasted Pesto**: Roast the garlic and nuts before blending for a deeper, caramelized flavor.

7. **Spicy Pesto**: Add red pepper flakes or fresh chilies for a spicy kick.

Pasta with Tuna and Olives is a delightful and quick dish that combines the richness of tuna with the briny flavor of olives, making it both satisfying and savory. It's perfect for a weeknight dinner or a lunch option that packs well. Plus, it's an excellent way to incorporate pantry staples into a delicious meal.

### Ingredients

**For the Pasta:**
- 300g (10.5 oz) pasta (e.g., spaghetti, penne, or fusilli)
- Salt (for boiling water)

**For the Sauce:**
- 1 can (about 150-200g) tuna in olive oil or water, drained and flaked
- 100g (about 3.5 oz) black or green olives, pitted and sliced
- 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, adjust to taste)
- 1 can (about 400g) diced tomatoes (or 2-3 fresh tomatoes, chopped)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil or parsley (for garnish, optional)
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, to serve)

### Step-by-Step Preparation Method

1. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   - Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
   - Add the red pepper flakes (if using) for an extra kick. Stir briefly.

3. **Add Tomatoes and Tuna:**
   - Incorporate the diced tomatoes into the skillet and stir. 
   - Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes, allowing flavors to meld.
   - Gently fold in the flaked tuna and sliced olives. 
   - Cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated through.

4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**
   - Add the drained pasta directly into the skillet. 
   - Toss together gently to combine everything. 
   - If the sauce seems too thick, add a little reserved pasta water until the desired consistency is reached.

5. **Season and Serve:**
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
   - Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if desired.

### Variations

1. **Vegetarian Option:**
   - Replace tuna with chickpeas for a plant-based alternative, keeping the olives for flavor.

2. **Different Proteins:**
   - Use canned sardines or anchovies for a different seafood twist.

3. **Add Vegetables:**
   - Incorporate sautéed spinach, kale, or bell peppers for added nutrition and flavor.

4. **Spicier Version:**
   - Include chopped fresh chili or use a spicy olive oil to increase the heat.

5. **Herb Variations:**
   - Experiment with other herbs like oregano, thyme, or even a sprinkle of lemon zest for brightness.

This Pasta with Tuna and Olives recipe is versatile and simple to make, allowing for plenty of customization based on your tastes and what you have on hand.

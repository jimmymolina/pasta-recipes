Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian pasta dish that beautifully showcases the simplicity and flavor profile of its few ingredients. It’s quick to prepare, making it a favorite for weeknight dinners or when unexpected guests visit. 

The combination of garlic, olive oil, and chili flakes creates a fragrant and slightly spicy sauce that coats the pasta perfectly. 

This dish is not only delicious but also offers versatility with variations and add-ons, catering to a range of dietary preferences.

<u><b>Ingredients</b></u>

<b>For 2 servings of Aglio e Olio Pasta, you will need:</b>

- 200g (7 oz) spaghetti or linguine

- 4-6 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced

- 60ml (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil

- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust based on spice preference)

- Salt (to taste)

- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta**:

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

   - Add the spaghetti or linguine and cook according to package instructions until al dente.

   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**:

   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

   - Add the sliced garlic and sauté gently, stirring frequently, until golden and fragrant. 
   
   - Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.

3. **Add the Spices**:

   - Once the garlic is golden, add the red pepper flakes and sauté for another 30 seconds.

   - 

4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**:

   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet, tossing it to coat in the garlic oil.

   - If the pasta seems dry, gradually add some of the reserved pasta cooking water until you reach the desired consistency.

5. **Season and Serve**:

   - Taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt, if needed.

   - Remove from heat and stir in the chopped parsley.

   - Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.


<u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. <u><b>Add Protein</b></u>:

   - **Shrimp**: Sauté shrimp in the olive oil before adding garlic for a heartier dish.

   - **Chicken**: Cook diced chicken breast in the skillet before adding garlic.

2. <u><b>Vegetarian Options</b></u>:

   - **Broccoli or Spinach**: Toss in blanched broccoli florets or sautéed spinach with the garlic.

   - **Mushrooms**: Sauté sliced mushrooms alongside the garlic for extra umami.

3. <u><b>Pasta Variations</b></u>:

   - Swap out spaghetti for other pasta shapes like penne, fettuccine, or gluten-free pasta.

   -  

4. <u><b>Enhanced Flavor</b></u>:

   - **Lemon**: Add fresh lemon juice and zest for a bright, citrusy flavor.

   - **Anchovies**: For a savory depth, add finely chopped anchovies to the oil before the garlic.

5. <u><b>Herbs and Spices</b></u>:

   - Experiment with fresh basil, oregano, or thyme for additional herbal notes.

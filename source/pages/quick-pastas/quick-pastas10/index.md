### Ingredients:

#### For the Pasta:
- 300g (10.5 oz) pasta (fettuccine, linguine, or your choice)
- Salt (for boiling water)

#### For the Mushroom Sauce:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
- 500g (about 1 lb) mushrooms (e.g., cremini or button), sliced
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
- ½ cup (120ml) vegetable broth or white wine
- 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream (or a dairy-free alternative)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

### Step-by-Step Preparation Method:

1. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. 
   - Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   - Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Mushroom Sauce:**
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. 
   - Once the butter is melted and bubbling, add the chopped onion.
   - Sauté the onion for about 3-4 minutes until it becomes translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.

3. **Cook the Mushrooms:**
   - Increase the heat to medium-high and add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet. 
   - Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and have released their moisture.

4. **Add Flavor:**
   - Stir in the thyme and pour in the vegetable broth or white wine. 
   - Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the liquid to reduce slightly.

5. **Create the Sauce:**
   - Reduce the heat to medium-low. 
   - Add the heavy cream to the skillet and stir well. 
   - Allow the sauce to simmer for about 5 minutes, thickening slightly. 
   - If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach desired consistency.

6. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**
   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet, tossing gently to coat the pasta in the creamy mushroom sauce. 
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. **Serve:**
   - Divide the pasta among plates, and garnish with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. 

    Enjoy!

### Variations:

1. **Vegetarian/Vegan Option:**
   - Replace heavy cream with coconut milk or a cashew cream for a vegan version. 
   - Use vegetable broth instead of white wine.

2. **Herb Variations:**
   - Experiment with different herbs such as rosemary, oregano, or basil for varied flavors.

3. **Protein Additions:**
   - Add grilled chicken, shrimp, or sautéed tofu for a protein boost.

4. **Cheese Variations:**
   - Incorporate different cheeses like goat cheese or feta for distinct flavor profiles.

5. **Spice It Up:**
   - Add crushed red pepper flakes for a kick or a splash of soy sauce for umami depth.

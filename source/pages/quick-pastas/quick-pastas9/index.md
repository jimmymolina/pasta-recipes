The creamy cheese sauce melds perfectly with the pasta and can be enhanced with various ingredients based on preference.



### Ingredients:

#### For the Pasta:
- 2 cups of uncooked pasta (penne, rotini, or elbow macaroni work well)
- Salt (for boiling water)

#### For the Cheese Sauce:
- 2 cups of milk (whole or 2% for creaminess)
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
- 2 cups of shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or a cheese blend)
- 1 teaspoon of garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon of onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard or a dash of hot sauce for flavor.

#### Optional Toppings:
- 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs (for a crunchy topping)
- Extra shredded cheese for topping
- Fresh herbs (like parsley or basil) for garnish



### Step-by-Step Preparation Method:

#### Step 1: Cook the Pasta
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
3. Drain the pasta and set aside.

#### Step 2: Make the Cheese Sauce
1. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbly and golden (this is called a roux).
3. Gradually whisk in the milk, continuing to stir until the mixture thickens (about 5-7 minutes).
4. Once thickened, reduce the heat and stir in the shredded cheese until melted and smooth.
5. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. For added flavor, incorporate Dijon mustard or hot sauce if using.

#### Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce, stirring until the pasta is evenly coated.

#### Step 4: Assemble and Bake
1. Transfer the pasta and cheese mixture to a greased baking dish (about 9x13 inches).
2. If desired, sprinkle breadcrumbs and/or additional cheese on top for a crunchy finish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until bubbly and golden on top.

#### Step 5: Serve
1. Let the baked pasta cool for a few minutes before serving.
2. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired and enjoy!

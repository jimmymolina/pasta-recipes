--Mix well and simmer for a few minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.

<b>Stir in the pasta:</b>

--Add the cooked fusilli to the pan and stir well so that the pasta is coated with the sauce.

<b>Season:</b>

--Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.

<b>Serve:</b>

<b>**Different Cheese:</b> Experiment with different types of cheeses like mozzarella or gouda to alter the flavor of the sauce.

<b>**Spices:</b> Add a touch of nutmeg to the white sauce for a deeper flavor, or sprinkle with chili powder if you prefer a spicy kick.

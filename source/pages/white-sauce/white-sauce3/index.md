<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation</b></u>

<b>Cooking the pasta:</b>

--Add the grated Parmesan cheese and stir until melted.

--Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of hot red pepper if desired.

<b>To combine with pasta:</b>

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

<b>**With Vegetables:</b> Add fresh spinach or broccoli when cooking the shrimp to incorporate more vegetables into the dish.

<b>**With Lemon:</b> Add a little lemon zest and juice at the end of cooking for a citrusy touch.

<b>**Garlic Shrimp:</b> If you prefer a more intense flavor, you can cook the shrimp with more garlic and a touch of red pepper.

<b>**Protein Substitutes:</b> Try this recipe with other seafood like calamari or mussels, or you can even make it with diced chicken.

<b>**Dairy-Free Sauce:</b> For a vegan version, you can use coconut cream instead of cream and omit the cheese, or use a vegan substitute.

<u><b>Preparation</b></u>

<b>Cooking the Pasta:</b>

--In a large pot, bring water to a boil.

<b>Combine:</b>

-If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little of the reserved cooking water to obtain the desired consistency.

--Gently stir until the pasta is well coated with the sauce.

<b>Serving:</b>

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

<b>**With Chicken:</b>

Add cooked, shredded chicken breast to the sauce before mixing with the pasta.

<b>**With Vegetables:</b>

Add vegetables such as spinach, broccoli or bell peppers, sautéing them along with the mushrooms.

<b>**Vegan Version:</b>

Substitute olive oil for butter, plant-based milk for milk, and omit the cheese or use a vegan substitute.

<b>**Mustard Sauce:</b>

Add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the sauce for a different twist.

<b>**With Seafood:</b>

Add shrimp or calamari in the last few minutes of cooking the sauce for a more sophisticated dish.

This dish is versatile and you can adjust it according to your preferences and available ingredients.

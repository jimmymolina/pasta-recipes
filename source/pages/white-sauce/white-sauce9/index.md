<b>Mix the chicken:</b>

--In a large bowl, mix the shredded chicken with some of the white sauce (to help keep it from drying out) and the spinach if you want to use it.

<b>Assemble the lasagna:</b>

--In a baking dish, place a layer of white sauce on the bottom. Then, place 3 lasagna sheets.

<b>Add the filling:</b>

--Add a layer of the chicken mixture, followed by a layer of white sauce, then sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese.

<b>Repeat Layers:</b>

--Repeat the process (lasagna sheets, chicken mixture, white sauce, cheese) until all ingredients are gone, finishing with a layer of white sauce and the remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese on top.

<b>Bake:</b>

Pasta carbonara is a classic of Italian cuisine, but in its "white" version it differs from the traditional one by dispensing with the egg yolk and guanciale (which is a type of pancetta).

Instead, a cream is used that gives it a rich and smooth texture.

This preparation is ideal for those looking for a comforting and creamy dish, perfect to share at a family dinner or among friends.

<u><b>Ingredients for 4 servings:</b></u>

--400 g of pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, or your choice)

--200 g of pancetta or bacon.

--200 ml of heavy cream.

--100 g of grated parmesan cheese (plus a little more to serve)

--2 cloves of garlic.

--Salt to taste.

--Black pepper to taste.

--Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation</b></u>

<b>Cook the pasta:</b>

--Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.

--Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente.

--Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta.

<b>Prepare the pancetta:</b>

--In a large skillet over medium heat, add the bacon or bacon cut into small pieces and cook until golden and crispy.

--This will take about 5-7 minutes.

<b>Add the garlic:</b>

--Add the peeled and whole garlic cloves to the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes to flavor the pancetta.

--Then, remove the garlic from the pan.

<b>Stir in the cream:</b>

--Reduce the heat to low.

--Add the cream to the pan with the bacon and mix well.

--Cook over low heat for a few minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.

<b>Add the cheese:</b>

--Stir the grated Parmesan cheese into the cream and bacon mixture.

--Stir well until the cheese melts and is fully incorporated.

--If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the pasta cooking water to thin the sauce.

<b>Mix with the pasta:</b>

--Add the cooked pasta to the pan and mix well to coat with the sauce.

--Adjust salt and pepper to taste.

<b>Serve:</b>

--Serve hot, sprinkling a little more grated Parmesan cheese on top and, if desired, some chopped fresh parsley for garnish.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

<b>**Mushroom Carbonara Pasta:</b> Add fresh sautéed mushrooms to the pancetta mixture for an earthy twist.

<b>**Vegetarian Carbonara:</b> Substitute smoked tofu chunks or vegetables like sautéed zucchini and eggplant for the pancetta.

<b>**Chicken Carbonara:</b> Add grilled or pan-seared chicken breast, in chunks, for a heartier version.

<b>**With Lemon:</b> Add a little lemon zest to the sauce for a fresh, vibrant flavor.

<b>**Whole Wheat or Gluten-Free Pasta:</b> Use whole wheat or gluten-free pasta for a healthier option or one that accommodates dietary restrictions.

<b>Recipe: Tagliatelle with Calamari in Tomato Sauce</b>

<u><b>Ingredients</b></u>

- **For the pasta:**

  - 400g tagliatelle (fresh or dried)

  - Salt (for boiling water)

- **For the calamari tomato sauce:**

  - 400g calamari (cleaned and cut into rings)

  - 400g canned chopped tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes, diced)

  - 2-3 tablespoons olive oil

  - 2 cloves garlic (minced)

  - 1 small onion (finely chopped)

  - 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust for spice preference)

  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano

  - Salt and black pepper (to taste)

  - Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)

  - Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the tagliatelle and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Drain and set aside, reserving a cup of pasta water.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**

   - In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

   - Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. 

   - Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for an additional minute until fragrant.
   
3. **Add Tomatoes:**

   - Stir in the canned chopped tomatoes (or fresh diced tomatoes). Add the dried oregano and season with salt and black pepper.

   - Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to slightly thicken.

4. **Cook the Calamari:**

   - Add the calamari rings to the sauce and cook for another 3-5 minutes, or until they turn opaque. 
   
   - Be careful not to overcook them, as calamari can become tough if cooked for too long.

5. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**

   - Add the cooked tagliatelle to the sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta with the sauce. 
   
   - If the sauce is too thick, use some reserved pasta water to loosen it.

   - Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

6. **Serve:**

   - Plate the tagliatelle with calamari and top with fresh basil leaves. 
   
   - Optionally, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese before serving.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. **Add Vegetables:**

   -Incorporate vegetables such as bell peppers, zucchini, or spinach for added nutrition and flavor. Sauté these before adding the tomatoes.

2. **Use Different Seafood:**

   -Mix in shrimp or mussels for a seafood medley. Adjust cooking times accordingly to ensure everything is cooked just right.

3. **Creamy Version:**

   -Add a splash of heavy cream or a dollop of mascarpone cheese for a creamy sauce that contrasts beautifully with the tomato base.

4. **Herb Variations:**

   -Experiment with different fresh herbs like parsley, thyme, or dill. Fresh parsley can be added just before serving for a fresh burst of flavor.

5. **Spice it Up:**

   -If you enjoy heat, add more red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce to the sauce for an extra kick.

This dish is versatile and can easily be tailored to suit your taste preferences!

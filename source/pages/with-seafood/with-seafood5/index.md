  - 300g (10.5 oz) fresh salmon fillet, skinless and boneless

  - Salt and pepper, to taste

  - 1 tablespoon olive oil

- **For the Cream Sauce:**

  - 1 tablespoon butter

  - 1 medium onion, finely chopped

  - 2 cloves garlic, minced

  - 200ml (about ¾ cup) heavy cream

  - Zest of 1 lemon

  - 50g (1.75 oz) Parmesan cheese, grated

- **To Garnish:**

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

   - Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the penne pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Drain and set aside, reserving a little pasta water.

2. **Prepare the Salmon:**

   - Season the salmon fillet with salt and pepper. 
   
   - In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   
   - Add the salmon and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side until golden and cooked through. 
   
   - Remove from the skillet and let it cool slightly before flaking it into bite-sized pieces.

3. **Make the Cream Sauce:**

   - In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. 
   
   - Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes. 
   
   - Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.

   - Pour in the heavy cream, along with the lemon zest and juice, stirring to combine. 
   
   - Bring to a gentle simmer and allow it to thicken slightly for about 3-4 minutes. 
   
   - If the sauce gets too thick, you can add a splash of reserved pasta water.

4. **Combine and Serve:**

   - Add the flaked salmon and chopped dill to the sauce, stirring gently to combine. 
   
   - Add the cooked penne pasta and toss everything together until the pasta is well coated. 
   
   - Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if necessary.

   - Serve immediately, garnished with additional dill and lemon wedges on the side.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. **Vegetarian Version:**

2. **Herbs:**

   -Experiment with other herbs like tarragon or parsley instead of dill for a different flavor profile.

3. **Spicy Kick:**

   -Add red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce to the cream sauce for a spicy twist.

4. **Different Fish:**

   -Substitute salmon with trout or even shrimp for a change in seafood.

5. **Add Greens:**

   -Stir in fresh spinach or peas for added nutrition and color.

6. **Cheese Variation:**

   -Try using feta cheese instead of Parmesan for a tangy flavor.

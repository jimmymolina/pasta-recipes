<u><b>Recipe

Ingredients</b></u>

- **Pasta:**

  -300g (10.5 oz) orecchiette pasta

- **Sauce:**

  - 4-6 anchovy fillets (canned in oil)

  - 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

  - 2 cloves garlic, minced

  - 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, adjust to taste)

- **Greens:**

  -150g (5 oz) fresh arugula, washed and roughly chopped

- **To Finish:**

  - Salt, to taste

  - Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the orecchiette and cook according to package instructions until al dente (about 9-11 minutes). 
   
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**

   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

   - Add the minced garlic and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.

   - Add the anchovy fillets and red pepper flakes, stirring until the anchovies dissolve into the oil (about 2-3 minutes).

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**

   - Once the anchovies have melted, add the drained orecchiette to the skillet. 
   
   - Toss well to coat the pasta with the sauce.

   - If the pasta seems dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.

4. **Add Arugula:**

   -Stir in the chopped arugula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the arugula has wilted.

5. **Season:**

   -Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed.

6. **Serve:**

   - Divide the pasta among plates. 
   
   - Top with grated Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if desired.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

- **Vegetarian Option:** Omit the anchovies and replace them with sundried tomatoes or olives for a different flavor profile.

- **Protein Addition:** Add cooked shrimp or chicken to boost the protein content of the dish.

- **Nutty Flavor:** Toss in some toasted pine nuts or walnuts for added texture and flavor.

- **Lemon Zest:** Add the zest of a lemon for a fresh, citrusy accent.

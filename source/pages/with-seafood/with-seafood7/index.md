Spaghetti with Lobster and Garlic Butter is a luxurious dish that's perfect for special occasions or a treat on a cozy night in. 

The combination of sweet lobster meat with the richness of garlic butter creates a flavorful, elegant pasta dish that is sure to impress.

<u><b>Ingredients</b></u>

**For the Spaghetti:**

- 8 oz (225g) spaghetti

- Salt (for pasta water)

**For the Lobster:**

- 1 lb (450g) lobster (whole or lobster tails)

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter

- 4-6 cloves garlic, minced

- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

- Lemon wedges (for serving)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Lobster:**

   - If using a whole lobster, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the lobster and cook for 8-10 minutes until the shell turns bright red. If using lobster tails, steam them for about 6-8 minutes.

   - Remove the lobster from the pot and let it cool slightly. 
   
   - Extract the meat from the shell and cut it into bite-sized pieces. 
   
   - Set aside.

2. **Cook the Spaghetti:**

   - In the same pot, bring salted water back to a boil and add the spaghetti. 
   
   - Cook according to package instructions until al dente (about 8-10 minutes).

   - Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.

3. **Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce:**

   - In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. 
   
   - Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. 
   
   - Be careful not to let the garlic brown.

   - If using red pepper flakes, add them at this stage for a bit of heat.

4. **Combine the Ingredients:**

   - Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic butter. 
   
   - Toss to coat evenly, adding some reserved pasta water to help create a silky sauce.

   - Stir in the lobster meat gently, cooking just long enough to heat through. 
   
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Serve:**

   - Divide the lobster spaghetti among plates. 
   
   - Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the top.


<u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. **Herb-Infused Oil:**

   -Instead of using plain butter, infuse the butter with herbs like thyme or basil for a more aromatic flavor.

2. **Creamy Variation:**

   -For a creamier sauce, add 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the garlic butter after sautéing the garlic. 
   
   -Let it simmer briefly before adding the pasta and lobster.

3. **Add Vegetables:**

   -Incorporate seasonal vegetables such as cherry tomatoes, spinach, or asparagus for added color and nutrition.

4. **Wine Sauce:**

   -Deglaze the pan with a splash of white wine after sautéing the garlic, allowing it to reduce before adding the pasta.

5. **Pesto Twist:**

   -Mix in some basil pesto along with the garlic butter for a herbaceous kick.

This dish is not only delightful in flavor but also visually stunning, making it a great choice for dinner parties or date nights.


 <b><i>Enjoy!</i></b>

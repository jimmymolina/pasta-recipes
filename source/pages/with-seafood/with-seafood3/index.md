<u><b>Ingredients:</b></u>

- **Pasta:**

  -300g (10 oz) spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccine

- **Mussels:**

  -1 kg (2.2 lbs) fresh mussels, cleaned and debearded

- **Aromatics:**

  - 2 tablespoons olive oil

  - 4 cloves garlic, minced

  - 1 small onion, finely chopped

  - 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)


- **Wine Sauce:**

  - 200ml (about 1 cup) dry white wine

  - 1 lemon (zest and juice)

  - Salt and pepper to taste

  - Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

- **Optional Ingredients:**

  - 1 tablespoon butter (for a richer sauce)

  - 1/4 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (for added flavor and color)

  - Fresh basil or oregano for garnish

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method:</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package instructions. 
   
   - Drain and reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water.

2. **Prepare the Mussels:**

   -Rinse the mussels under cold water, scrub them clean, and discard any that are open or damaged.

3. **Sauté Aromatics:**

   - In a large, deep skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   
   - Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. 

   - Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for an additional minute until fragrant.

4. **Add Wine and Mussels:**

   - Pour in the white wine and lemon juice, bringing it to a gentle simmer. 
   
   - Allow it to cook for about 2 minutes.

   - Add the mussels to the skillet, cover, and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mussels have opened.

5. **Combine and Serve:**

   - Once the mussels are cooked, add spaghetti to the skillet. 
   
   - Toss to combine with the mussels and wine sauce, adding reserved pasta water a little at a time if needed to loosen the dish. 

   - Season with salt, pepper, and lemon zest to taste. 
   
   - Stir in the butter (if using) until melted.
  
6. **Garnish:**

   - Remove from heat and garnish with fresh parsley. 
   
   - Serve immediately with extra lemon wedges on the side.

<u><b>Variations:</b></u>

- **Tomato-Based Version:** Add a can of diced tomatoes (400g) with the wine for a tomato-based sauce.

- **Creamy Sauce:** Stir in 100ml of heavy cream or crème fraîche at the end for a creamy version of the dish.

- **Vegetable Additions:** Include spinach or arugula just before serving for added greens.

- **Herbs and Spices:** Experiment with different herbs like thyme, dill, or herbs de Provence for unique flavor profiles.

- **Seafood Mix:** Combine mussels with other seafood such as shrimp or calamari for a mixed seafood pasta.

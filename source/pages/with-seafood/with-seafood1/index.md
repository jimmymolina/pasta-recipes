<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method:</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Seafood:**

   - In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. 
   
   - Add the garlic and onion, sautéing until the onion is translucent and fragrant.

3. **Add the Tomatoes:**

   -Stir in the cherry tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the tomatoes to soften and 
   juices to release.

4. **Deglaze:**

   - Pour in the white wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet to release any flavorful bits. 
   
   - Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes until the alcohol evaporates.

5. **Cook the Seafood:**

   - Add the mussels and clams first, followed by the shrimp and calamari. 
   
   - Stir well, cover the skillet, and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mussels and clams open up. 
   
   - Discard any that do not open.

6. **Combine with Pasta:**

   - Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet, tossing everything together. 
   
   - If the mixture is too dry, gradually add the reserved pasta water until you reach the desired consistency. 
   
   - Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using) to taste.

7. **Serve:**

   - Plate the spaghetti al frutti di mare and garnish with freshly chopped parsley. 
   
   - Serve with lemon wedges on the side.

<u><b>Variations:</b></u>

- **Spicy Version:** Add more red pepper flakes or finely chopped fresh chili for a spicy kick.

- **Creamy Version:** Stir in a splash of heavy cream at the end for a creamy sauce.

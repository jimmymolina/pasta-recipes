Linguine with Clams and Parsley is a classic Italian dish celebrated for its simplicity and depth of flavor. 

The combination of fresh clams, garlic, parsley, and a splash of white wine creates a delicious, briny sauce that clings beautifully to the linguine. This dish is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a more formal occasion.

**Ingredients:**

- 400g (14 oz) linguine

- 1 kg (2.2 lbs) fresh clams (such as littlenecks or razor clams), cleaned

- 4 tablespoons olive oil

- 4 cloves garlic, minced

- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

- 1 cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc)

- Salt to taste

- Freshly ground black pepper to taste

- 1 cup fresh parsley, chopped

- Zest of 1 lemon (optional, for garnish)

- Lemon wedges (for serving)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method:</b></u>

1. **Pasta Preparation:**

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the linguine and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the linguine and set it aside.

2. **Clams Preparation:**

   - In a large skillet or shallow pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   
   - Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using), and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant, but not browned.

3. **Cooking the Clams:**

   - Add the cleaned clams to the skillet along with the white wine. 
   
   - Cover the pan with a lid and increase the heat to medium-high. 
   
   - Cook for about 5-7 minutes or until the clams have opened. 
   
   - Discard any clams that remain closed.

4. **Combining Ingredients:**

   - Once the clams are cooked, reduce the heat to low. 
   
   - Add the drained linguine directly into the skillet with the clams. 
   
   - Toss everything together, adding a bit of reserved pasta water if you need to loosen the sauce.

5. **Finishing Touch:**

   - Stir in the chopped parsley, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. 
   
   - If desired, add lemon zest for extra brightness.

6. **Serve:**

     -Plate the linguine with clams immediately, garnishing with extra parsley and providing lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the dish.

<u><b>Variations:</b></u>

- **Add Vegetables:** Incorporate chopped tomatoes, spinach, or zucchini for added nutrition and flavor.

- **Broth Variation:** Replace the white wine with clam juice or fish stock for a richer clam flavor.

- **Spicy Version:** Increase the amount of red pepper flakes or add diced fresh chili for a spicier kick.

- **Creamy Linguine:** For a creamy version, stir in a splash of heavy cream or crumbled feta after adding the pasta.

- **Different Noodles:** Swap linguine for spaghetti, fettuccine, or even gluten-free pasta for variety.


Linguine with Clams and Parsley is an elegant yet straightforward dish that’s both comforting and festive.

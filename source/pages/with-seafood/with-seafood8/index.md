<u><b>Ingredients</b></u>

- **Fusilli pasta**: 300g

- **Octopus**: 500g, cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces

- **Padrón peppers**: 200g, washed and stems removed

- **Garlic**: 2 cloves, sliced

- **Extra virgin olive oil**: 4 tablespoons

- **White wine**: 100ml (optional)

- **Vegetable or seafood broth**: 500ml

- **Fresh parsley**: 2 tablespoons, chopped

- **Salt and pepper**: to taste

- **Red pepper flakes**: (optional for extra heat)

- **Lemon wedges**: for serving


<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Prepare the Octopus**: 

   - If using fresh octopus, ensure it is cleaned and cut into bite-sized pieces. 
   
   - If using frozen octopus, thaw it and drain any excess water.

2. **Cook the Pasta**: 

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the fusilli and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the rest.

3. **Sauté the Octopus**:

   - In a large skillet or frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.

   - Add the octopus pieces and sauté for 5-7 minutes until they start to become tender. 
   
   - If using, pour in the white wine and let it cook for another 2-3 minutes until the alcohol evaporates.

4. **Cook the Padrón Peppers**:

   - In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil and the Padrón peppers. 
   
   - Sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until they blister and soften.

5. **Combine Ingredients**:

   - Add the sliced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant (be careful not to burn).

   - Pour in the broth (vegetable or seafood) and bring to a simmer. 
   
   - Let it cook for about 5-7 minutes to blend the flavors, then season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if desired.

6. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**:

   - Add the cooked fusilli into the skillet and toss everything together. 
   
   - If the dish seems dry, add some reserved pasta water to achieve a desired consistency.

7. **Finish and Serve**:

  -Stir in the chopped parsley and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve hot, drizzled with more olive oil and lemon wedges on the side.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

- **Spicy Version**: Add more red pepper flakes or diced fresh chili for an extra kick.

- **Herb Variations**: Experiment with other herbs like basil or dill for a different flavor profile.

- **Vegetarian Option**: Substitute octopus with grilled zucchini or asparagus for a vegetarian twist.

- **Creamy Sauce**: Add a splash of cream or mascarpone cheese for a richer, creamier dish.

- **Different Pasta Shapes**: Swap fusilli with other pasta shapes like penne or farfalle.

- **Add Seafood**: Incorporate shrimp or mussels along with octopus for a seafood medley.


This dish perfectly balances flavors, is easy to modify to fit your taste, and makes for an impressive meal.

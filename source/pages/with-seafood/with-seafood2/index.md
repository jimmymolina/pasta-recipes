<u><b>Ingredients</b></u>

**For 4 servings:**

- 12 oz (340 g) fettuccine pasta

- 1 lb (450 g) large prawns, peeled and deveined

- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced

- 1/2 cup (120 ml) dry white wine (or chicken broth)

- 1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream

- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil

- 1 tablespoon butter

- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

- Salt and pepper to taste

- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Prepare the Ingredients**: 

   - Peel and devein the prawns if not already done. 

   - Mince the garlic and chop the parsley.

2. **Cook the Fettuccine**: 

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 

   - Add the fettuccine and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Drain, reserving a cup of pasta water.

3. **Sauté the Garlic**: 

   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. 

   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, until fragrant but not browned.

4. **Add the Prawns**: 

   -Add the prawns to the skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque.

5. **Deglaze the Pan**: 

   -Pour in the white wine (or chicken broth) and let it simmer for 1-2 minutes to reduce slightly.

6. **Make the Sauce**:

   - Stir in the heavy cream and red pepper flakes (if using). 

   - Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for another minute or until the sauce thickens slightly.

7. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**: 

   - Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the sauce, tossing well to coat. 

   - If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency.

8. **Serve**: 

   - Garnish with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. 
   
   - Serve immediately.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. **Vegetable Addition**: Add seasonal vegetables such as spinach, cherry tomatoes, or asparagus for added color and nutrition.

2. **Spicy Version**: Increase the amount of red pepper flakes for a spicier kick, or incorporate other spices like paprika or cayenne.

3. **Lemon Zest**: Add the zest of one lemon to the sauce for a zesty brightness, or serve with lemon wedges.

4. **Herb Variations**: Swap parsley for basil or cilantro for a different flavor profile.

5. **Whole Wheat or Gluten-Free Pasta**: Use whole wheat fettuccine for a healthier twist, or opt for gluten-free pasta to make this dish suitable for those following gluten-free diets.

6. **Creamy Tomato Variation**: Stir in a few tablespoons of tomato paste or diced tomatoes to the sauce for a richer, tomato-flavored version.

This dish is versatile and can be customized to suit your taste preferences while still delighting your palate!

Rigatoni with Tomato Basil Sauce is a classic Italian dish that combines the robust texture of rigatoni pasta with a fresh, aromatic sauce.

This recipe is perfect for those looking for a comforting yet simple dish, ideal for any occasion.

-800 g canned tomatoes (can be crushed or whole)

-2-3 cloves garlic, chopped.

-1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil.

-Salt to taste.

-Black pepper to taste.

-A bunch of fresh basil.

-Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation</b></u>

<b>Cook the pasta:</b>

---In a large pot, bring plenty of salted water to a boil.

<b>Add the tomatoes:</b>

---Add the canned tomatoes to the pan. If using whole tomatoes, mash them with a wooden spoon.

---Add salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.

---If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved cooking water to reach the desired consistency.

---Toss well to make sure the pasta is covered with the sauce.

<b>Serve:</b>

---Serve hot on individual plates and sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top, if desired.

---Garnish with a few additional basil leaves.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

<b>***Spicy Version:</b> Add some crushed red pepper to the olive oil while you sauté the garlic for a spicy kick.

<b>***Roasted Tomato Sauce:</b> You can roast fresh tomatoes in the oven before making the sauce for a deeper, smoky flavor.

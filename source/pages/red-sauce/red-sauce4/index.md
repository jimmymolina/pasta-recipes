Spaghetti alla napolitana is a classic dish of Italian cuisine, known for its simplicity and vibrant flavours.

Its origin dates back to the region of Naples, where tomato sauce was used as a base for many pasta preparations.

This dish is appreciated for its combination of al dente pasta with a rich and aromatic tomato sauce.

It is perfect for a family meal or a dinner with friends, and its versatility allows it to adapt to different tastes.

<u><b>Ingredients for 4 servings:</b></u>

<b>Spaghetti:</b> 400 g.

<b>Tomatoes:</b> 800 g of fresh ripe tomatoes (you can use canned if you prefer)

<b>Olive oil:</b> 4 tablespoons.

<b>Garlic:</b> 2 cloves, finely chopped.

<b>Onion:</b> 1 small, chopped.

<b>Salt:</b> To taste.

<b>Black pepper:</b> To taste.

<b>Fresh basil:</b> A handful, chopped (optional)

<b>Grated parmesan cheese:</b> To serve (optional)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation</b></u>

<b>Cook the pasta:</b>

--Bring salted water to a boil in a large pot. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions, until al dente.

--Drain and set aside.

<b>Make the sauce:</b>

--If using fresh tomatoes, blanch them in boiling water for a minute, then cool in ice water and peel.

--Cut the tomatoes into cubes. If you prefer to use canned tomatoes, just crush them.

--In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

--Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until translucent.

--Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, avoiding burning.

<b>Add the tomatoes:</b>

--Add the tomatoes to the pan, mixing well.

--Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld.

--If the sauce is very acidic, add a teaspoon of sugar to balance.

<b>Season the sauce:</b>

--Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.

--Add some chopped fresh basil, if desired.

<b>Mix the pasta and sauce:</b>

--Add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the sauce and mix well to coat the pasta with flavor.

--Cook everything together for 2-3 minutes.

<b>Serve:</b>

--Remove from the heat and serve hot, sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese and, if desired, more fresh basil.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

<b>***With meat:</b>

Add sautéed ground beef to the sauce for a heartier version, similar to bolognese.

<b>***With vegetables:</b>

Include vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini, or bell peppers to add more texture and flavor.

<b>***Spicy version:</b>

Add crushed red pepper or chili sauce to give the sauce a spicy kick.

<b>***With seafood:</b>

Try adding shrimp or mussels for a more sophisticated version.

<b>***Gluten-free and vegan:</b>

Use gluten-free spaghetti and omit the parmesan cheese or substitute a vegan cheese.

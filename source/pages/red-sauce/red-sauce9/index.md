Penne Arrabbiata is a classic dish of Italian cuisine, originating from the Lazio region, and is known for its simplicity and characteristic spicy kick.

The term "arrabbiata" translates as "angry", which refers to the spicy mix of garlic, chilli and tomato used in the sauce.

This pasta is ideal for those looking for a quick meal but full of flavour and an explosion of aromas.

In addition, Penne Arrabbiata is a very versatile dish that can be adapted to different tastes and food preferences.

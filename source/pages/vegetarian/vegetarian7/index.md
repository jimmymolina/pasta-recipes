<u><b> Ingredients</b></u>


#### For the Lasagna ####


- **9-12 lasagna noodles** (regular or no-boil)

- **1 medium eggplant**, sliced into ¼-inch rounds

- **1 medium zucchini**, sliced into ¼-inch rounds

- **2 cups marinara sauce** (store-bought or homemade)

- **15 oz ricotta cheese**

- **1.5 cups mozzarella cheese**, shredded

- **½ cup Parmesan cheese**, grated

- **1 large egg**

- **1 tsp garlic powder**

- **1 tsp dried oregano**

- **1 tsp salt**

- **½ tsp black pepper**

- **Olive oil** (for brushing)

- **Fresh basil leaves** (optional, for garnish)


 <u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>


#### Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables ####

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Slice the eggplant and zucchini into ¼-inch rounds. 

3. Place the slices on a baking sheet and brush lightly with olive oil. 

4. Sprinkle with salt.

5. Roast the vegetables in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are tender and slightly golden. 

6. Remove from the oven and set aside.

#### Step 2: Make the Ricotta Mixture ####

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and black pepper. 

2. Mix until well combined.

#### Step 3: Cook the Lasagna Noodles ####

1. If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to the package instructions until al dente. 

2. Drain and set aside.

#### Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna ####

1. In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom.

2. Layer 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by half of the ricotta mixture, half of the roasted vegetables, and a third of the mozzarella cheese.

3. Pour a layer of marinara sauce over the mozzarella.

4. Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta mixture, roasted vegetables, mozzarella, and marinara. Finish with a final layer of noodles and cover with the remaining marinara sauce.

5. Top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

#### Step 5: Bake the Lasagna ####

1. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray).

2. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.

3. Let it cool for about 10-15 minutes before slicing.

#### Step 6: Serve ####

1 Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, and serve hot.

 <u><b>Variations</b></u>

- **Add Other Vegetables**: Incorporate spinach, kale, mushrooms, or bell peppers for extra flavor and nutrition.

- **Dairy-Free Option**: Substitute ricotta and mozzarella with cashew cheese or vegan cheese alternatives.

- **Gluten-Free Option**: Use gluten-free lasagna noodles.

- **Herbed Variation**: Add fresh herbs such as parsley or basil to the ricotta mixture for an added fresh flavor.

- **Spicy Kick**: Add red pepper flakes for some heat or use spicy marinara sauce.

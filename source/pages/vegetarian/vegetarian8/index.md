<b>Ingredients</b>

 **Pasta:**


  -12 oz (340 g) pasta (penne, fusilli, or any preferred shape)

  
**Spinach Filling**:

  - 1 tablespoon olive oil

  - 2 cloves garlic, minced

  - 10 oz (280 g) fresh spinach, washed and roughly chopped (or 1 cup frozen spinach, thawed and drained)

  - 1 cup ricotta cheese

  - 1 cup grated mozzarella cheese, divided (plus extra for topping)

  - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

  - 1 large egg

  - Salt and pepper to taste

  - 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)


 **Sauce**:


  -2 cups marinara sauce (homemade or store-bought)

  
 **Topping**:


  - 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional, for a crispy topping)

  - Extra grated Parmesan cheese for sprinkling

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>


1 **Preheat the Oven**: 

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2 **Cook the Pasta**: 

In a large pot, boil salted water and cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

3 **Prepare the Spinach Filling**:


   -In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.

   -Add the spinach and sauté until wilted (if using fresh) or heated through (if using frozen). Remove from heat and allow it to cool slightly.

   -In a large mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half the mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, nutmeg (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.

   -Stir in the sautéed spinach until evenly incorporated.

4 **Assemble the Pasta**:

   - In a large baking dish (about 9x13 inches), spread half of the marinara sauce on the bottom.

   - Layer half of the cooked pasta over the sauce.

   - Spread the spinach and ricotta mixture over the pasta.

   - Add the remaining pasta on top, then pour the rest of the marinara sauce over it.

   - Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese and the extra Parmesan cheese on top.

5 **Add Topping (optional)**: 

-If you like a crispy topping, mix breadcrumbs with a bit of olive oil and sprinkle over the cheese.

6 **Bake**: 

-Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. 

-Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.

7.**Cool and Serve**:

 A-low the baked pasta to cool for about 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy!

<u><b>Variations</b></u>


- **Protein Addition**: Add cooked chicken, sausage, or ground beef to the spinach filling or mix it with the pasta for added protein.


- **Cheese Variations**: Substitute ricotta with cottage cheese or cream cheese for a different texture. Experiment with different cheeses like feta or goat cheese for added flavor.


- **Vegetable Additions**: Incorporate other vegetables such as mushrooms, zucchini, or bell peppers into the filling for a heartier dish.


- **Herbs and Spices**: Enhance the flavor by adding fresh herbs such as basil, oregano, or thyme, or spices such as crushed red pepper for a bit of heat.


- **Gluten-Free Options**: Use gluten-free pasta to suit dietary preferences.

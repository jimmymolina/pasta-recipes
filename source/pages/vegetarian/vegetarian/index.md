<u><b>Ingredients</b></u>

- **For the Fettuccine**:

  - 12 oz fettuccine pasta

  - Salt (for pasta water)

- **For the Pumpkin Sauce**:

  - 1 cup pumpkin puree (canned or fresh)

  - 1/2 cup heavy cream

  - 2 tablespoons olive oil or unsalted butter

  - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced

  - 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

  - Salt and pepper to taste

  - 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (plus extra for serving)

  - Fresh sage leaves (about 8-10 leaves, chopped or whole for garnish)

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Fettuccine**:

   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the fettuccine and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   
   - Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the fettuccine and set it aside.

2. **Prepare the Pumpkin Sauce**:

   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. 
   
   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.

3. **Add the Pumpkin**:

   - Stir in the pumpkin puree, heavy cream, and ground nutmeg. 
   
   - Mix well and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. 
   
   - If the sauce is too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.

4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**:

   - Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet and toss it in the pumpkin sauce until well coated. 
   
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Add Parmesan**:

   - Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and combined, enhancing the creaminess of the sauce.

   - 

6. **Serve**:

   - Plate the fettuccine and top with fresh sage leaves and additional Parmesan cheese. 
   
   - Serve with a drizzle of olive oil if desired.

 <u><b>Variations</b></u>

1. **Add Protein**: Incorporate cooked chicken, sausage, or shrimp for added protein.

2. **Vegetarian Option**: Include sautéed mushrooms, spinach, or kale for extra vegetables and nutrients.

3. **Make it Vegan**: Substitute heavy cream with coconut milk or cashew cream, and use nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan.

4. **Spicy Kick**: Add a pinch of red pepper flakes for an extra layer of flavor and heat.

5. **Nuts and Seeds**: Top with toasted pine nuts or walnuts for a crunchy texture.

Penne Arrabbiata is a classic Italian pasta dish characterized by its spicy tomato sauce. Adding roasted peppers brings a sweet, smoky flavor that enhances the dish, making it a perfect choice for those who enjoy a bit of heat combined with depth. This dish is quick to prepare, making it an excellent option for a weeknight dinner or a casual gathering. 

**Ingredients:**

- **For the Pasta:**

  - 400g penne pasta

  - Salt (for pasta water)

- **For the Sauce:**

  - 3 tablespoons olive oil

  - 4 cloves garlic, minced

  - 1-2 fresh red chili peppers, chopped (or 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes)

  - 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes

  - Salt to taste

  - Freshly ground black pepper to taste

  - 2 tablespoons fresh parsley or basil, chopped (optional, for garnish)

- **For the Roasted Peppers:**

  - 2 large bell peppers (red or yellow)

  - 1 tablespoon olive oil

  - Salt and pepper to taste

  - 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional)

### Step-by-Step Preparation Method:

1. **Roast the Peppers:**

   - Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F).

   - Cut the bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and stems.

   - Place them on a baking sheet, cut side down. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

   - Roast in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, until the skins are blistered and charred.

   - Remove from the oven and cover with foil to steam for about 10 minutes. This will help loosen the skins.

   - Once cool, peel off the skins, slice, and set aside.

2. **Cook the Pasta:**

   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. 
   
   - Add the penne pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 

   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

3. **Prepare the Arrabbiata Sauce:**

   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.

   - Add the chopped chili peppers (or red pepper flakes) and cook for an additional minute.

   - Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and the optional balsamic vinegar. 
   
   - Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

4. **Combine:**

   - Add the roasted peppers to the sauce, stirring gently to combine.

   - Add the cooked penne to the skillet, tossing everything to coat well. 
   
   - If the sauce seems too thick, add some reserved pasta water until the desired consistency is achieved.

5. **Serve:**

   - Plate the pasta and garnish with chopped parsley or basil if desired. 
   
   - Serve warm.

### Variations:

1. **Add Protein:** Incorporate grilled chicken, sausage, or shrimp for added protein.

2. **Extra Vegetables:** Mix in sautéed spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms for additional nutrients.

3. **Creamy Version:** Stir in a splash of heavy cream or a dollop of ricotta for a richer sauce.

4. **Spicy Variations:** For an extra kick, increase the amount of chili peppers or add a splash of hot sauce.

5. **Cheesy Twist:** Top with freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese before serving.

Penne Arrabbiata with Roasted Peppers is a delightful dish that balances heat and sweetness, making it a favorite for pasta lovers. <b><i>Enjoy your cooking!</i></b>

This recipe is versatile, allowing for various types of pasta and mushrooms, making it easy to customize according to your taste and what you have on hand.

#### Ingredients
- **Pasta**: 12 oz (e.g., fettuccine, penne, or spaghetti)
- **Mushrooms**: 8 oz (cremini, button, or shiitake), sliced
- **Heavy cream**: 1 cup
- **Garlic**: 2-3 cloves, minced
- **Onion**: 1 small, diced
- **Olive oil**: 2 tablespoons
- **Butter**: 2 tablespoons
- **Parmesan cheese**: ½ cup, grated (plus extra for serving)
- **Salt**: to taste
- **Black pepper**: to taste
- **Fresh parsley**: for garnish (optional)

#### Step-by-Step Preparation Method

1. **Cook the Pasta**:
   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. 
   - Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables**:
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat.
   - Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
   - Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

3. **Cook the Mushrooms**:
   - Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and turn golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. 
   - Season with salt and pepper.

4. **Make the Cream Sauce**:
   - Reduce the heat to low and pour in the heavy cream. 
   - Stir to combine and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing it to thicken slightly.
   - Mix in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth. If the sauce is too thick, add a little reserved pasta water to reach desired consistency.

5. **Combine with Pasta**:
   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss to coat evenly in the sauce. 
   - If needed, add more reserved pasta water for a creamier texture. 
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

6. **Serve**:
   - Plate the pasta and garnish with fresh parsley and additional Parmesan cheese.

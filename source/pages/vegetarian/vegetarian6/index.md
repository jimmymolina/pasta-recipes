This dish is not only visually appealing but also nutritious and satisfying.

#### Ingredients:
- **Pasta**: 8 oz (such as penne, farfalle, or spaghetti)
- **Vegetables** (choose a mix of the following seasonal options):
  - 1 cup asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
  - 1 cup peas (fresh or frozen)
  - 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
  - 1 cup zucchini, diced
  - 1 cup bell peppers, sliced
- **Aromatics**:
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 small onion, chopped
- **Herbs**:
  - 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
  - 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
  - Salt and pepper to taste
- **Sauce**:
  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- **Cheese** (optional):
  - Grated Parmesan or feta cheese for serving

#### Step-by-Step Preparation Method:

1. **Cook the Pasta**:
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   - Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. **Sauté Aromatics**:
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   - Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until translucent and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.

3. **Add Vegetables**:
   - Add the asparagus and bell peppers to the skillet and sauté for about 5 minutes.
   - Then add the zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and peas. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.

4. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**:
   - Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the vegetables.
   - Pour in the lemon juice and zest and enough reserved pasta water to loosen the mixture if needed. Toss everything together until well combined.

5. **Season and Serve**:
   - Stir in the fresh basil and parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Serve warm, topped with grated Parmesan or crumbled feta cheese if desired.

#### Variations:
- **Protein Addition**: Incorporate grilled chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas for added protein.
- **Pasta Types**: Use whole wheat pasta or gluten-free options to suit dietary preferences.
- **Vegetable Swap**: Substitute or add other vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, or artichokes based on availability.
- **Herbal Flavor**: Experiment with different herbs like thyme or dill for a unique flavor profile.
- **Creamy Version**: Add a splash of cream or a dollop of mascarpone cheese for a richer sauce.
- **Spicy Kick**: Incorporate crushed red pepper flakes for added heat.

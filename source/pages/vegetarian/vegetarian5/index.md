### Tagliatelle with Tomato and Basil Sauce


Tagliatelle with Tomato and Basil Sauce is a delightful Italian dish that combines the richness of fresh tomatoes with the aromatic freshness of basil. The wide, flat noodles of tagliatelle provide an excellent canvas for the sauce, allowing it to cling beautifully. This dish is not only easy to prepare but also showcases the vibrant flavors of its few key ingredients, making it perfect for both weeknight dinners and special occasions. 

### Ingredients:

- **For the pasta:**
  - 400g (14 oz) fresh or dried tagliatelle
- **For the sauce:**
  - 800g (28 oz) ripe tomatoes (or 2 cans of whole peeled tomatoes)
  - 3-4 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - Fresh basil leaves (a handful)
  - Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)

### Step-by-Step Preparation Method:

1. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - If using fresh tomatoes, blanch them by boiling them for about 1 minute until the skins loosen. Transfer them to cold water, then peel and chop. If using canned tomatoes, skip this step.
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute (do not let it brown).
   - Add the chopped tomatoes to the skillet. If using canned, crush the tomatoes gently with a spoon. Season with salt and pepper.
   - Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.

2. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the tagliatelle according to package instructions until al dente. Fresh pasta typically cooks faster (about 2-4 minutes).
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.

3. **Combine:**
   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly in the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little reserved pasta water to achieve your desired consistency.
   - Stir in the fresh basil leaves just before serving.

4. **Serve:**
   - Plate the tagliatelle and drizzle with extra olive oil if desired. Top with grated Parmesan cheese and additional fresh basil, and enjoy!

### Variations:
1. **Vegetable Add-Ins:**
   - Add sautéed vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, or spinach to the sauce for extra nutrition and flavor.

2. **Spicy Kick:**
   - Incorporate red pepper flakes into the sauce for a hint of heat.

3. **Protein Boost:**
   - Include cooked chicken, shrimp, or Italian sausage for a heartier version.

4. **Herb Variations:**
   - Experiment with different herbs like oregano or thyme along with the basil for added depth.

5. **Creamy Twist:**
   - For a creamier sauce, stir in a splash of heavy cream or a dollop of ricotta cheese before serving.

This dish is versatile and can easily be customized to suit different tastes and dietary preferences, making it a staple in many kitchens. <b><i>Enjoy your tagliatelle with tomato and basil sauce!</i></b>

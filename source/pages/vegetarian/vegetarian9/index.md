<b>Ingredients</b>

- **Pasta:**
  - 8 oz fusilli pasta
- **Vegetables:**
  - 1 cup bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), sliced
  - 1 cup zucchini, sliced
  - 1 cup carrots, julienned or sliced
  - 1 cup broccoli florets
  - 1/2 cup onion, thinly sliced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
- **Sauce:**
  - 3 tablespoons soy sauce (use low-sodium if preferred)
  - 1 tablespoon sesame oil (or olive oil)
  - 1 teaspoon ginger, minced (optional)
  - 1 tablespoon rice vinegar (optional)
- **Garnish:**
  - Sesame seeds (for sprinkling)
  - Green onions, chopped (for sprinkling)

### Step-by-Step Preparation

1. **Cook the Fusilli:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
   - Add the fusilli and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
   - Drain and set aside, reserving a little pasta water.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - While the pasta is cooking, wash and chop all the vegetables into bite-sized pieces.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
   - Add the onion and minced garlic; sauté for about 2 minutes until fragrant.
   - Add the carrots and bell peppers; cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.
   - Add the zucchini and broccoli, cooking for another 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently. The vegetables should be tender but still crisp.

4. **Combine Pasta and Vegetables:**
   - Once the vegetables are cooked, add the drained fusilli to the skillet.
   - Pour in the soy sauce and mix well, ensuring the pasta is coated with the sauce. If the mixture seems dry, add a splash of reserved pasta water.
   - If using ginger and rice vinegar, add them at this point for additional flavor.

5. **Serve:**
   - Remove from heat and serve hot.
   - Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions before serving.

### Variations

1. **Protein Addition:**
   - Add grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu for extra protein. If using tofu, sauté it separately until golden before adding to the vegetable mixture.

2. **Different Sauces:**
   - Experiment with teriyaki sauce, hoisin sauce, or a spicy chili sauce for a different flavor profile.

3. **Vegetable Variations:**
   - Use seasonal vegetables like asparagus, snap peas, or mushrooms. You can also include leafy greens like spinach or kale towards the end of the cooking process.

4. **Herb and Spice Variations:**
   - Add fresh herbs like cilantro, basil, or mint for a refreshing twist. Also, consider adding red pepper flakes for heat or a pinch of five-spice powder for depth.

5. **Noodle Variations:**
   - Substitute fusilli with other types of pasta like penne, spaghetti, or even zoodles (zucchini noodles) for a gluten-free or low-carb option.

This Fusilli with Sautéed Vegetables and Soy Sauce recipe is versatile and can be tailored to your tastes and dietary needs.

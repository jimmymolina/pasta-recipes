Spaghetti with Basil and Walnut Pesto is a delightful and vibrant dish that brings fresh flavors to the table. The combination of fresh basil and the richness of walnuts creates a creamy, aromatic pesto that clings beautifully to the spaghetti. This dish is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner, yet elegant enough for entertaining guests. It’s also versatile; you can easily adjust ingredients based on your taste or what you have on hand. 

### Recipe for Spaghetti with Basil and Walnut Pesto

#### Ingredients

**For the Pesto:**
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves, packed
- ½ cup walnuts
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional for a vegan version)
- ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Juice of ½ lemon (optional)

**For the Spaghetti:**
- 12 ounces spaghetti (or your pasta of choice)
- Salt for the pasta water

#### Step-by-Step Preparation

1. **Prepare the Pesto:**
   - In a food processor, combine basil leaves, walnuts, and garlic. Pulse until roughly chopped.
   - Add Parmesan cheese (if using), and pulse a few more times to combine.
   - With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the pesto reaches your desired consistency. You may need to scrape down the sides occasionally.
   - Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Spaghetti:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.

3. **Combine Spaghetti and Pesto:**
   - In a large bowl, combine the drained spaghetti with the prepared basil and walnut pesto.
   - If the pesto is too thick, gradually mix in reserved pasta water until you achieve the desired sauce consistency.

4. **Serve:**
   - Plate the spaghetti, and garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and walnut pieces if desired. Enjoy!

### Variations

- **Nut Alternatives:** Substitute walnuts with pine nuts, almonds, or pecans for different nutty flavors.
- **Cheese-Free:** Omit the Parmesan cheese for a dairy-free or vegan version. You can use nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor without dairy.
- **Herb Variations:** Mix in or substitute different herbs like parsley, arugula, or cilantro for a unique twist.
- **Add-Ins:** Serve with cherry tomatoes, sautéed vegetables (like zucchini or bell peppers), or olives for added texture and flavor.
- **Protein Boost:** Toss in cooked chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas to make it a heartier meal.
- **Spicy Kick:** Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the pesto for some heat.

This Spaghetti with Basil and Walnut Pesto is a wonderful dish to make any day of the week, adaptable to various diets and tastes!

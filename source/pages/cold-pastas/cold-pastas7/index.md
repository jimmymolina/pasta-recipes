Caesar Style Pasta Salad combines the freshness of a salad with the heartiness of pasta.

This twist on the classic Caesar salad traditionally features lettuce, grilled chicken and croutons, and is enhanced with a creamy Caesar dressing.

The addition of pasta creates a more complete dish, ideal as a main dish or side dish. Perfect for lunch, a light dinner or even to take on a picnic.

<u><b>Ingredients for the salad:</b></u>

250 g pasta (can be fusilli, penne or your favorite)

200 g chicken breast (optional)

2 cups romaine lettuce, chopped

1/2 cup croutons (you can buy them or make them at home)

1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)

Salt and pepper to taste

<u><b>Ingredients for the Caesar sauce:</b></u>

1/2 cup mayonnaise

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1 clove garlic, minced

2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Salt and pepper to taste

<u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation</b></u>

<b>Cook the pasta:</b>

In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente.

Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking.

<b>Set aside.</b>

Cook the chicken (optional):

If you choose to include chicken, season the breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder if desired.

Cook in a skillet with a little oil over medium heat until golden and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes per side.

Let rest and cut into strips or cubes.

<b>Make the Caesar dressing:</b>

In a bowl, mix the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.

Whisk well until smooth.

Adjust seasoning to taste.

<b>Mix the salad:</b>

In a large bowl, combine the cooked pasta, chicken, chopped lettuce, croutons, and Caesar dressing.

Mix carefully until all ingredients are well coated.

<b>Serving:</b>

Divide the salad among plates, sprinkle a little more Parmesan cheese on top, and add more croutons if desired.

Serve immediately.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

<b>-Vegetarian Caesar Salad:</b> Omit the chicken and add cooked chickpeas or cubed avocado for extra satiety.

<b>-Whole Wheat Pasta:</b> Use whole wheat or legume pasta for a healthier version.

<b>-Roasted Veggies:</b> Add roasted vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, or broccoli for extra flavor and nutrition.

<b>-Alternative Sauce:</b> For a lighter option, mix Greek yogurt with the Caesar sauce ingredients instead of mayonnaise.

<b>-Alternative Protein:</b> Add tuna instead of chicken for a different, protein-rich flavor.

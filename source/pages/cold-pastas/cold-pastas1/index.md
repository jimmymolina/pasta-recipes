### Cold Pasta with Yogurt and Herb Sauce


Cold Pasta with Yogurt and Herb Sauce is a light, refreshing meal perfect for warm days or as a side dish for picnics and barbecues. The creamy yogurt sauce, flavored with fresh herbs, beautifully coats al dente pasta, making it a flavorful yet simple dish. This recipe is not only quick to prepare but also allows for plenty of variations based on seasonal ingredients or personal tastes.

#### Ingredients

 **For the pasta:**
   8 oz (225 g) pasta (such as fusilli, penne, or farfalle)

   Salt, for pasta water

 **For the yogurt herb sauce:**
   1 cup plain yogurt (Greek or regular)

   1 clove garlic, minced (optional)

   2 tablespoons olive oil

   2 tablespoons lemon juice (freshly squeezed)

   Salt and pepper, to taste

   1/4 cup fresh herbs, finely chopped (such as dill, parsley, mint, or basil)

   Grated zest of 1 lemon (optional)

 **Garnishes (optional):**

   Cherry tomatoes, halved

   Cucumber, diced

   Feta cheese, crumbled

   Extra herbs for sprinkling

 <u><b>Step-by-Step Preparation Method</b></u>

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.

    Drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside to drain completely.

2. **Prepare the Yogurt Herb Sauce:**

    In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, minced garlic (if using), olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. 
    
    Mix until smooth.

    Stir in the freshly chopped herbs and lemon zest (if using). Adjust seasoning to taste.

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**

    In a large bowl, add the drained pasta. Pour the yogurt herb sauce over the pasta and toss gently until the pasta is evenly coated. 

4. **Chill:**

    If time allows, cover the pasta and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. 

5. **Serve:**

    Serve the pasta chilled or at room temperature, garnished with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, feta, and extra herbs if desired.

<u><b>Variations</b></u>

- **Vegetable Add-ins:** Incorporate seasonal vegetables such as roasted bell peppers, zucchini, or asparagus for added flavor and nutrition.

- **Protein Boost:** Add cooked chicken, shrimp, or chickpeas to make the dish more filling.

- **Different Herbs:** Experiment with different herb combinations such as cilantro, chives, or tarragon based on your taste preferences.

- **Spicy Twist:** Add a pinch of red pepper flakes or a diced jalape√±o for a spicy kick.

- **Nutty Flavor:** Incorporate toasted nuts or seeds like pine nuts, almonds, or sunflower seeds for added crunch.


Cold Pasta with Yogurt and Herb Sauce is a versatile dish that can be customized to suit your taste or what you have on hand. It is healthy, quick to make, and can be a great dish to prepare in advance for gatherings or meal prep.

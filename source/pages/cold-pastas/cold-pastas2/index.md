### Step-by-Step Preparation:

1. **Cook the Pasta:**

    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**

   While the pasta is cooking, chop the spinach, halve the cherry tomatoes, dice the cucumber, and finely chop the red onion.

3. **Make the Dressing:**

    In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and honey or maple syrup until well combined.

4. **Combine Ingredients:**

    In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, chopped spinach, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, feta cheese, and olives (if using). 

5. **Dress the Salad:**

    Pour the dressing over the pasta and vegetables. Toss gently until everything is well coated with the dressing.

6. **Taste and Adjust:**

    Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or lemon juice if desired.

7. **Chill and Serve:**

    If possible, let the salad chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Serve cold or at room temperature.

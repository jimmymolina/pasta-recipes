<u><b>Preparation</b></u>

<b>Step 1: Cook the pasta</b>

--If you are using cannelloni sheets that are not precooked, boil them in plenty of water with a little salt for about 5 minutes, until they are pliable.

--Drain them and place them on a clean cloth so that they do not stick together.

<b>Step 2: Prepare the filling</b>

--In a large frying pan, heat a little olive oil over medium heat.

--Add the onion and sauté until transparent.

--Add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 more minute.

--Add the minced meat, season with salt and pepper, and cook until cooked through.

--If using spinach, add it at this step (you can use fresh or frozen spinach, well drained). Cook for a few minutes.

--Remove from heat and mix in the ricotta or mascarpone and half of the grated cheese.

<b>Step 3: Prepare the bechamel sauce</b>

--In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.

--Add the flour and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes.

--Pour in the milk little by little, stirring to avoid lumps. Cook the mixture until it thickens.

--Season with salt, pepper and a little nutmeg.

<b>Step 4: Assemble the cannelloni</b>

--Preheat the oven to 180°C.

--In a baking tray, pour a little bechamel sauce on the bottom.

--Fill each cannelloni sheet with the meat or spinach mixture, and roll up.

--Place the cannelloni on the tray, side by side.

--Top the cannelloni with the remaining bechamel sauce and sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese.

<b>Step 5: Bake</b>

--Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden and bubbly.

--Let rest for a few minutes before serving.

<b>Chicken and mushroom cannelloni:</b> Substitute cooked, shredded chicken for the minced meat, and add sautéed mushrooms.

<b>Fish cannelloni:</b> Fill the cannelloni with a mixture of white fish, seafood, and a little tomato sauce.

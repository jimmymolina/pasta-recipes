<u><b>Ingredients for lasagna:</b></u>


-9-12 sheets of lasagna pasta (can be pre-cooked)

-500 g fresh spinach (or 300 g frozen spinach)

-250 g ricotta cheese.

-200 g grated mozzarella cheese.

-100 g grated parmesan cheese.

-1 egg (optional)

-2 cloves garlic.

-2 tablespoons olive oil.

-Salt and pepper to taste.

-Tomato sauce (optional)



<u><b>Step-by-step preparation:</b></u>

<b>Prepare the spinach:</b>

--If using fresh spinach, wash and dry the leaves well.

--In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the minced garlic cloves.

--Sauté until golden.

--Add the spinach to the skillet and cook until wilted (about 5 minutes).

--If using frozen spinach, simply cook until thawed and well dried.

-Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

--Then, finely chop the spinach and mix with the ricotta cheese. Add salt, pepper, and beaten egg if using.




<b>Preheat the oven:</b>

-Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).




<b>Assemble the lasagna:</b>

--In a baking dish, spread a light layer of tomato sauce (if you choose to use it) on the bottom.

--Lay out a layer of lasagna sheets.

--Pour some of the spinach and ricotta mixture over the pasta and sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese.

-Repeat the process (pasta, spinach mixture, cheese) until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of pasta.

--In the final layer, add the rest of the mozzarella cheese and sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top.




<b>Bake:</b>

--Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.

--Then, remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.




<b>Serve:</b>


--Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving.

--You can accompany it with a fresh salad.




<b>Variations</b>

<b>***Add other vegetables:</b> You can add mushrooms, zucchini, or peppers for extra flavor and texture.

<b>***Alternative sauces:</b> Instead of tomato sauce, you can use a white sauce (béchamel) for a creamier lasagna.

<b>***Other herbs and spices:</b> Add fresh herbs like basil or oregano, or spices like nutmeg for a different touch.

<b>***Cheese substitutes:</b> If you prefer vegan options, you can use almond ricotta cheese or tofu and eliminate the egg.

This spinach and ricotta lasagna is an excellent option for those looking for a tasty and satisfying dish, ideal for sharing on any occasion. <b><i>Enjoy!</i></b>
